         <p>Traditionally, music was treated as an analogue signal and was generated manually.</p>

           <h3>LSTM</h3>
           <p>Long short-term memory is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network can process not only single data points, but also entire sequences of data.

           <h3>GAN</h3>
           <p>A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a machine learning (ML) model in which two neural networks compete with each other to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run unsupervised and use a cooperative zero-sum game framework to learn.</p>

         <h3>Conclusion.</h3>
         <p>We will be able to show that a multi-layer LSTM, character-level language model applied to two separate data representations is capable of generating music that is at least comparable to sophisticated time series probability density techniques prevalent in the literature. We will also compare different algorithms like GAN, WaveNet to determine the best musical generation algorithm model. We will also show that our models were able to learn meaningful musical structure.
